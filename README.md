# Bayesian Regression with Undirected Network Predictors with an Application to Brain Connectome Data (JASA, 2021)

We study the relationship between brain networks and creativity by identifying brain regions and connections that significantly impact creative ability. Unlike traditional approaches that vectorize network matrices and lose structural information, we develop a flexible Bayesian framework that preserves network structure, enables accurate prediction, and identifies key brain regions and connections. Our method introduces novel network shrinkage priors and provides uncertainty quantification through Bayesian inference.
