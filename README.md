# Bayesian-Network-Regression

This manuscript attempts to understand the relationship between human creativity as measured by the composite creativity index (CCI) and the human brain connectome network. An important scientific question in this context is to identify important brain regions and interconnections between the regions which actively impact the creativity of an individual. Additionally, accurate prediction of creativity levels from the brain network with precise characterization of uncertainty is of interest to statistical neuroscientists. We propose a Bayesian approach to regression with a continuous scalar response and an undirected network predictor to answer the scientific questions of interest. A novel class of network shrinkage priors for the network predictor coefficients is developed, which enables detection of influential nodes and edges in the network predictor that are predictive of the response. Adopting a Bayesian method leads to natural characterization of uncertainty related to the identification of influential nodes and edges, as well as the prediction of creativity from the brain connectome network.
